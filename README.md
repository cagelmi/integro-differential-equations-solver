# IDSOLVER: A general purpose solver for nth-order integro-differential equations

IDSOLVER is explained in full detail in the following paper:

[Gelmi C. and H. Jorquera. IDSOLVER: A general purpose solver for nth-order integro-differential equations.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010465513003093)

## Content

- IDSOLVER.M: Solver capable of solving integro-differential equations.

- IDSOLVEREX3.M: IDSOLVER modified to solve Example 3.

- EXAMPLES.M: file containing full five examples. They can be tested by: (i) cut-and-paste the codes in the Matlab Command Window or (ii) by simply running one by one using the "Evaluate cell" botton of the Matlab Editor.

## Python version

There is a Python version available through the PyPi repository, translated and manteined by Josh Karpel. The Python version can be found here:
